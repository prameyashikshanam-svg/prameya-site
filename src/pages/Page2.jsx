              Prameya Shikshanam is a not-for-profit organization that mainly focuses on
guiding children towards the right knowledge to make their lives pleasant and
happy from within, with the help of inspiring teachers and devoted parents
towards their children. It also helps them decide the path of righteousness,
which leads them towards their goal in this world of numerous choices.<br></br><br></br>
As the very name Prameya suggests, it stands for objects of knowledge which
have the authenticity to be known. It is used in Indian philosophical texts called
the Nyaya Shastra. 'PRAMEYA' tries to understand, check and verify the
authenticity of the knowledge that we come across in this world. PRAMA
means the true Knowledge.
 PRAMEYA means the objects of true knowledge,
and PRAMATRU means the one who knows this true knowledge.<br></br><br></br>

In this world, there are innumerable aspects of imbibing content. Therefore, the
knowledge we encounter from various resources must be verified before we
incorporate it into our curriculum to be taught to children and adults alike.
Knowledge that does not lead a person towards inner happiness and self-
realisation is not true knowledge. It can be a skill that is developed to earn
material comforts.
<br></br><br></br>
Prameya Shikshanam helps students in identifying the right kind of knowledge
through various Illustrations, Interactive Sessions, Activities and workshops.
Every value is explained with the effect it creates emotionally on the human
mind, bringing in the psychological aspects through the illustrations. This will
help them travel on the path of material success and inner happiness together, at
the same time, without any confusion. It channels their thinking process in such
a way that they do not get distracted by any negative path, thereby building their
mental strength.
